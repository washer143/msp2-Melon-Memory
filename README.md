#  Melon Memory
 ![responsive-media](screenshots/am-i-responsive.png)

# Introduction
This project is a classic memory game with a watermelon theme, where you click one card to reveal a character and you must choose another card to reveal the same character, if its not the same character you must restart and try to remember where those characters are to match the same two characters. When two characters are a match they will stay is position until all characters have been paired, with the final amount pairs being 8, revealing a time and the amount of moves it took to complete the game.

# Design
The goal of the game was to create and appealing and fun interactive game that the user can restart and play as many times as they wish. The game was designed with young users in mind targeting young children to adolescents, an emphasis on how fast and how many little moves you can do it in was used target the older age range, adding a competitive element to game. The timer counts up for as long is necessary so younger players don't have the added pressure of finishing the game under a set time. 

## Colors 
The color palette i chose for this project was obviously going to be based around watermelon colors, with an emphasis on contrast and brightness to intrigue a younger user to play the game. This was my initial color scheme.

## Fonts
The font chosen for the game was essential to the look and feel of the game, whilst searching i came across Rammetto One, i feel this font gave the game a very playful feel and would be attractive to a younger audience, with that in mind i made use of it throughout the game, to maintain the identity of the game.
